# BookbindingPdfMaker
A program to convert a single PDF into signatures for bookbinding.

# Installation
I'll put something here with instructions on installation.

# Suggestions?  Tips?
Please feel free to contact me if you can think of something to add or if something is broken.  Or, you can use the Issues tab to file a ticket so I can track it.

# Attributions
This is by no means an original idea.  I used <a href="http://www.quantumelephant.co.uk/bookbinder/bookbinder.html">Bookbinder</a> as inspiration.

I'm too lazy to draw my own icon right now, so I used one from Flaticon.  The icon comes from: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/book" title="book icons">Book icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
