# BookbindingPdfMaker
A program to convert a single PDF into signatures for bookbinding.

# Installation
The installation is pretty straightforward.
1. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/ScottCoursey/BookbindingPdfMaker/releases">releases area</a>.
2. Choose the version you want to install (usually the most current).
3. Locate the Assets and click the installer (.msi file).
4. Run the file on your hard drive and go through the installer.

If you have a previous version already installed, you'll be prompted if you want to remove the previous one.

# Attributions
This is by no means an original idea.  I used <a href="http://www.quantumelephant.co.uk/bookbinder/bookbinder.html">Bookbinder</a> as inspiration.

I'm too lazy to draw my own icon right now, so I used one from Flaticon.  The icon comes from: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/book" title="book icons">Book icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
